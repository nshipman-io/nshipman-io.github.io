      <description>#CloudGuruChallenge - Event Driven Python on AWS After being asked by many friends about transitioning into a DevOps role with no background; I began doing some digging and stumbled upon the Cloud Resume Challenge. The book opens up with a story about a plumber learning to code while dealing with literal shit, then proceeds to give the curious an open-ended challenge to complete.
Some further digging I stumbled upon A Cloud Guru&amp;rsquo;s Event-Driven Python challenge and decided to jump in as a means to overcome my fear of serverless functions and build some new skills.</description>
